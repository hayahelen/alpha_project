//update permissions in the same time (without deleting the entire unit) in rolePermissionAssignment table
in repo roles


when updating role: 
{
    name: "Admin",
    permissions: [{id: 4}, {id:5}]
}

in that case you should go to the rpa table and get the current links, delete unmentioned roles and add the mentioned roles. 
this should delete the unmentioned, add the new and keep the mentioned. 

routes:
/roles -> roles table
/permissions -> permissions table
/roles/:id/permissions -> permissions by id 




.gitignore

password handling and update handling change naming of file
permissionIds not permissionsId
middleware called permit that takes as parameters multiple permissions 

status code if no permission, and if permission call next()
